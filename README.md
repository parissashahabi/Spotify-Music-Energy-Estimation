# Spotify Music Energy Estimation

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating the energy of Persian music tracks available on Spotify. Using machine learning techniques, the model focuses on leveraging the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) regressor and Linear Regression algorithms.

### Problem Statement

The main objective is to design a model that can accurately predict the energy level of a given music track. This model will help in understanding the dynamics of music tracks and can be used for various applications like playlist curation and music analysis.

### Desired Outcomes

The project involves several key steps:

1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:** Initial exploration and preparation of the dataset for modeling.
2. **Model Development:** Building models using MLP and Linear Regression to estimate the energy of music tracks.
3. **Explanation and Evaluation:** Detailed explanations of each step in the data analysis and modeling process. The performance of the models is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
